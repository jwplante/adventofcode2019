# Advent of Code 2019 Solutions

## About
This is my repository for my solutions for the Advent of Code 2019 event.
Most solutions are written in Python 3 and will take in any problem inputs as a 
file named `input.txt`. The main goal for these implementations are to solely 
get an accurate output and not for brevity or elegance, so there may be a more optimal 
solution than shown here. That being said, please feel free to leave a pull 
request if my solutions could be improved.  

Here is a [link](https://adventofcode.com/) to the Advent of Code site if you 
want to try these coding problems out on your own.
